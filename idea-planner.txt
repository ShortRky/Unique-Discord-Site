Base Discord Profile Website:

Auto-plays a lo-fi remix of your favorite WuWa/Horimiya OSTs (respects browser autoplay rules—starts muted with a tiny floating speaker you tap).
 • Has a “live” Spotify now-playing pill (no auth needed—uses Last.fm → Spotify “scrobble” route, or a 100 % client-side fallback that shows your last public Spotify image via their open API).
 • A tiny, animated chess board that plays a never-ending, aesthetically valid game (I’ll pre-generate a short grandmaster PGN and loop it with smooth piece slides).
 • Endless vertical scroll-text that feels like the old Star-Wars crawl, but pastel-on-dark with subtle sakura-petals drifting across it.
 • Social icons that appear only when you hover the bottom-left corner (Discord, GitHub, Twitter/X, YouTube, AniList—just edit one JSON file).
 • Zero build tools—plain HTML + CSS + vanilla JS.

 Unique Idea for thee?

- Text very slowly drifts
	•	Occasionally a letter misaligns, then corrects itself
- Scolling text
    (	•	single sentences
	•	aphorisms
	•	quiet observations

Example tone (not content you must use):

“Some things don’t hurt.
They just stay.”)

- glowing text
- Mochi subtly “breathes” (scale 0.98 → 1.02)
	•	On click, it changes the site mode:
	•	Day / Night
	•	Text speed
	•	Music track
Deep charcoal background
	•	Matcha green accent
	•	Warm off-white text
	•	Muted sakura pink (particles only)
	•	Soft gray for UI
- A “Silence Timer”
	•	A tiny counter somewhere unobtrusive
	•	It shows how long the page has been open
	•	No labels, no explanation

- A clock (live time)
