# ✨ Unique Discord Profile

A handcrafted, minimalist profile website that blends aesthetic design with interactive elements. Built from the ground up with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no build tools, no frameworks, just pure web magic.

## 🎯 What Is This?

This is a **personal profile page** designed to stand out. It's not just a static resume or boring landing page—it's a living, breathing digital space that showcases who you are through carefully curated visuals, smooth animations, and thoughtful interactions.

Think of it as your Discord-inspired profile, but *cooler*. A place where your personality and work live together in harmony.

## ✨ Features

### 🎬 **Centered Feature Video**
A large, autolooping video player sits at the heart of the page. Perfect for showcasing your latest project, vlog, or creative work. Mutes on page load (respecting browser policies), unmutes on interaction.

### 🌸 **Sakura Particle Animation**
Gentle, drifting sakura petals float across the entire background—a subtle nod to elegance and calm. Beautiful without being distracting.

### ⏰ **Live Clock & Silence Timer**
A real-time clock in the top-left shows the current time. Alongside it, a "silence timer" counts how long you've been on the page—a quiet way to measure contemplation.

### 📜 **Vertical Crawling Text**
Inspired by the classic Star Wars crawl, vertical text slowly scrolls with poetic, introspective lines. Letters occasionally misalign and correct themselves, adding a subtle glitch-art aesthetic.

### ♟️ **Animated Chess Board**
A tiny 8×8 chessboard plays out a legendary checkmate (Scholar's Mate) on infinite loop. Each piece moves smoothly, then resets—a perfect metaphor for strategy and patience.

### 🔗 **Social Links Hub**
Quick access to your profiles: Twitch, YouTube, AniList, and more. Hidden in the bottom-left corner, revealed with a single click. Links open in new tabs with zero interruption.

### 🎵 **Audio Player**
A floating speaker button controls background music playback. Shuffle, loop, and skip tracks directly from your configured playlist (stored in `config.js`).

### 🎨 **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**
Click the breathing mochi 🍡 in the top-right to toggle between dark and light themes. The entire page adapts instantly—colors, shadows, everything.

### 📱 **Fully Responsive**
Built to look stunning on desktop, tablet, and mobile. The video scales beautifully; layouts adapt intelligently.

### ⚙️ **Zero-Config Customization**
Everything is controlled via a single `config.js` file:
- Change your profile picture, description, and status.
- Add/remove social links.
- Customize crawling text, music, colors, and effects.
- No code changes needed—just edit the config.

## 🤔 Why?

In a world of cookie-cutter portfolio sites and LinkedIn profiles, this exists as a **rebellion**. A statement that your digital presence doesn't have to fit into a template.

**Key reasons:**

1. **Authenticity**: This site feels like *you* because it *is* you. No corporate template can compete with the personal touch.

2. **Minimalism Done Right**: Every element serves a purpose. The sakura petals aren't random noise—they're thoughtful. The chess game isn't just decoration—it's a metaphor.

3. **Performance**: Built with vanilla JavaScript and optimized CSS, this site is *fast*. No bloat, no unnecessary frameworks.

4. **Ownership**: You control 100% of your digital presence. Host it anywhere, modify it freely, make it uniquely yours.

5. **A Creative Flex**: Shows employers/collaborators that you can build something beautiful from scratch. No design tools, no UI kits—just skill and taste.
